# Sea-Debris-Classification
This project was developed during the Daksh AI Hackathon at SASTRA University by our team, Aqua Avengers. The goal is to classify sea debris and marine creatures using a deep learning model, helping in ocean cleanup and marine life conservation.

🏆 Key Features
✅ Pretrained Model: Used InceptionResNetV2 with custom layers for better accuracy.
✅ Dataset: 7,000+ annotated images of marine waste and sea creatures.
✅ Image Annotation: Processed using Roboflow for precise labeling.
✅ Data Augmentation: Improved model performance with flipped, rotated, and cropped images.
✅ Model Performance: Optimized using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques.
